# 🔍 Pose Estimation for Security Purpose - AI Mini Project  

## 📌 Introduction  
The **Pose Estimation for Security Purpose** project enhances surveillance systems by detecting suspicious activities and unusual body movements in real time. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this system analyzes human poses from video feeds, helping security teams identify potential threats efficiently.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Real-Time Pose Detection**: Detects and tracks human body movements instantly.  
- **Multi-Person Pose Estimation**: Recognizes multiple individuals in crowded areas.  
- **Security Alerts**: Flags suspicious behaviors for quick action.  
- **Seamless Integration**: Can be incorporated into existing security camera systems.  
- **Scalable Design**: Works in high-traffic areas such as airports, stadiums, and offices.  

## 🏗️ Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning**: OpenPose, Deep Learning (CNNs)  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook  
- **System Design**: UML Diagrams, Block Diagrams
